# Description

**GeoPDEs** is an **open and free** package for the research and teaching of **Isogeometric Analysis**, written in **Octave** and fully compatible with **Matlab**.

The GeoPDEs package provides a common and flexible framework for implementing and testing new isogeometric methods for the solution of partial differential equations.

## Features

These are some of the main features of GeoPDEs: 

* Dimension independent implementation: the same code is valid for curves, surfaces and volumes.
* Implementation of multipatch domains, with conforming interfaces.
* Div- and curl-conforming spline spaces, also in multipatch domains.
* Examples for Poisson, linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, bilaplacian, Stokes and Maxwell equations.
* Adaptive methods with hierarchical B-splines (beta version).
* Detailed documentation, accessible with the _help_ command.
